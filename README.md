## Overview

_**And...Sold!** is a companion app for organizations running auctions. Users can create auctions, and for each auction, can keep track of a list of dealers, bidders, and lots. There is a screen just for entering bids, and also a screen for registering and checking out bidders._


<br>

## MVP


_The **And...Sold!** MVP consists of all of the basic screens and backend functions needed to perform the capabilities listed in the description. The MVP styling includes at least 2 media queries for responsive design. The project will have a RESTful JSON API with CRUD actions on tables._

<br>

### Goals

- _Require users to sign up/sign in and utilize authentication_
- _Create a RESTful JSON API including user, auction, dealer, bidder, lot, and transaction tables_
- _Create a React app to allow users to navigate the tasks of holding an auction, including bid entry and bidder management_
- _Style with flexbox and/or CSS Grid, and implement responsive design_
- _Use proper coding conventions_
- _Deploy frontend and backend_

## Post-MVP

- custom lot order for auction
- search/filter options for tables (especially lots, bidders, dealers)
- multiple types of users with different sets of permissions -> turning users/auctions into many-to-many relationship
